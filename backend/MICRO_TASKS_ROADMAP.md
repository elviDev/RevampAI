## üìä Time and Resource Estimates

**Total Development Time**: 280+ hours (14 weeks with 20 hours/week)
**Critical Path Dependencies**: Sequential execution required for foundational tasks
**Testing Overhead**: ~30% additional time for comprehensive testing
**Documentation**: Integrated into each task deliverable

**Key Milestones**:
- **Week 3**: Foundation complete, ready for voice integration
- **Week 6**: Basic voice commands working end-to-end
- **Week 9**: Complex commands and advanced features complete
- **Week 12**: Intelligence features and analytics operational
- **Week 14**: Production-ready system fully deployed

This roadmap ensures that each micro-task builds upon the previous work while maintaining testability and clear success criteria. The sequential nature allows for early validation of critical functionality while building toward the complete vision outlined in the success criteria document.
