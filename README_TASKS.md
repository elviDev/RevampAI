# Javier AI Project Management Platform ‚Äî Task & Progress Tracker

## üö¶ Project State (as of August 2025)

### **Current State**
- **Frontend:** React Native mobile app with modular, animated UI for tasks, assignees, tags, and modals.
- **Features:** Manual task/project creation, assignment, priorities, categories, tags, and team management.
- **UX:** Modern, glassmorphic, animated, and highly interactive (but still needs further polish to match AI-first vision).
- **Architecture:** Micro-component structure, utility-driven, easy to extend.
- **Missing:** All AI, automation, backend, integrations, and advanced features.

## üü° **Missing Pieces & Gaps**
1. **AI/NLU Backend:** No natural language or voice input processing.
2. **Voice Input & Meeting Capture:** No voice-to-plan, no meeting action mining.
3. **Integrations:** No Jira, Trello, Slack, Teams, Google Calendar, or GitHub integration.
4. **Proactive PM Logic:** No reminders, follow-ups, risk detection, or auto-reassignment.
5. **Reporting:** No auto-generated executive summaries or tailored reports.
6. **Predictive/Adaptive Features:** No timeline prediction, sentiment analysis, or adaptive learning.
7. **Web Frontend:** No web app for desktop users.
8. **Backend/API/Database:** No backend, API, or persistent storage.
9. **Hosting/DevOps:** No deployment, scalability, or cloud setup.
10. **UI/UX Enhancement:** The current UI needs to be upgraded and enhanced to better align with the AI-first, adaptive, and user-centric vision.
11. **Team Preference Adaptation:** The app should learn and adapt to each team's workflow, style, and preferences (not yet implemented).
