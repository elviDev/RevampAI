# TasksScreen Fixes - Summary

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Badge Overlapping Issue**
**Problem**: Status and priority badges were overlapping due to absolute positioning and insufficient spacing.

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate status badge that was positioned absolutely
- Reorganized badge layout to stack vertically in the task card header
- Added proper spacing and flex properties to prevent content overflow
- Used `flex-shrink-0` to prevent badges from being compressed
- Added `numberOfLines={1}` to prevent text wrapping in badges

### 2. **View Mode Selection Not Working**
**Problem**: Only list view was implemented, board and calendar view modes were missing.

**Solution**:
- **Board View**: Implemented a Kanban-style board with columns for different task statuses
  - Horizontal scrollable columns for `pending`, `in-progress`, and `completed` statuses
  - Each column shows task count and allows scrolling through tasks
  - Compact task cards optimized for board view
  - Drag-and-drop ready architecture

- **Calendar View**: Implemented a date-based task organization
  - Tasks grouped by due date with clear date headers
  - Fallback message for future calendar widget integration
  - Chronological sorting of task groups
  - Clean, timeline-style layout

### 3. **Layout Improvements**
**Problem**: Task cards had layout issues with text overflow and badge positioning.

**Solution**:
- Added proper flex properties to prevent content overflow
- Improved responsive design for different screen sizes
- Better spacing between elements
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with consistent padding and margins
